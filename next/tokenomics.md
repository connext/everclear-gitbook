## NEXT Allocations

The high-level allocations of NEXT are as follows:

<table><thead><tr><th width="291">Category</th><th width="172">% of total supply</th><th>Number of NEXT</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Community</td><td>50.94%</td><td>509,428,750</td></tr><tr><td>Early Backers</td><td>22.43%</td><td>224,338,119</td></tr><tr><td>Ecosystem &#x26; Strategic Backers</td><td>11.24%</td><td>112,352,000</td></tr><tr><td>Early Team &#x26; Advisors</td><td>11.61%</td><td>116,097,420</td></tr><tr><td>Proxima Labs</td><td>3.78%</td><td>37,783,010</td></tr></tbody></table>

The Community category can be further subdivided into:

<table><thead><tr><th>Category</th><th width="231.33333333333331">% of total supply</th><th>Number of NEXT</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>DAO</td><td>29.44%</td><td>294,350,509</td></tr><tr><td>Connext Foundation</td><td>10.94%</td><td>109,446,745</td></tr><tr><td>Airdrop</td><td>10.56%</td><td>105,631,496.18</td></tr></tbody></table>

{% hint style="info" %}
After carefully reviewing feedback, we found that certain categories of transactions were not being counted towards the airdrop as we originally intended. To provide the best possible outcome, we adjusted the eligibility criteria on August 24, 2023.
{% endhint %}

## Supply Schedule

Allocations of NEXT to the following categories of recipients are subject to a lockup period.

* Early Backers
* Ecosystem & Strategic Backers
* Early Team & Advisors
* 50% of tokens allocated to Routers and Community Advocates as part of the Airdrop (2.15% of the total supply)

The lockup period for Early Backers and Early Team & Advisors consists of a 15-month lockup followed by an 18-month **linear release**. In other words, 1/19 of the tokens will be released on December 6th, 2024, and the remaining tokens will unlock **linearly** in equal monthly 1/19 allotments until all tokens are fully unlocked (33 months after the NEXT Airdrop).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Edit: The lockup period and unlock schedule for Early Backers and Early Team & Advisors was amended as of September 3, 2024, as follows:\
\- The 1-year lockup period was extended to 15 months, with a new unlock date starting on December 6, 2024.\
\- The linear unlock period was extended from 12 to 18 months, with a new linear unlock rate of 1/19 per month, concluding on June 6, 2026.
