## The Challenge: Bootstrapping Crosschain Liquidity

In web3 today, new chains and solvers face a critical deadlock: chains need solvers to provide liquidity for users to enter their ecosystem, but solvers need to know there will be volume before deploying capital. Neither can move first.

Currently, chains must negotiate one-to-one deals with bridges, often spending $100K-1M+ on manual agreements. This process is inefficient and expensive, leaving many chains without proper bridge support and limiting ecosystem growth.

## The Solution: Vote-Bonding Mechanism

vbCLEAR creates a marketplace that transforms this process through a vote-bonding mechanism. By staking CLEAR, participants receive vote-bonded CLEAR (vbCLEAR), which allows them to direct incentives to specific chains, creating a coordinated system for liquidity deployment.

## Mechanism Details

### Staking

* Holders can stake CLEAR for periods ranging from 3 to 24 months
* Longer staking periods result in greater voting power through vbCLEAR
* Early unstaking is possible with penalties between 5 and 22.5% proportional to the remaining lock period
* Fixed yield is distributed to stakers based on lock time&#x20;
* Stakers can claim yield from any chain on a two-weekly distribution cadence

### Voting

* Voting occurs in two-week epochs
* vbCLEAR holders vote to direct emissions toward specific chains
* Votes must be recast each epoch
* Holders can delegate their voting power to active participants
* One vote per wallet per epoch
