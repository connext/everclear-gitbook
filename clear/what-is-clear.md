# What is CLEAR

{% include "../.gitbook/includes/review-notice.md" %}

CLEAR is the new [DAO-approved](https://snapshot.box/#/s:dao.connext.eth/proposal/0x92aaead8d6231df3ea56d88bc8396b59c8aec6a9a07e8489f1be52664318279f) governance and utility token of Everclear, replacing NEXT through a 1:1 migration. CLEAR is deployed as an [xERC20](https://xerc20.com/) (crosschain native) token. Learn more about the migration process.

## How is CLEAR used?

CLEAR serves multiple functions within the Everclear ecosystem:

### Governance

CLEAR holders can participate in governing the Everclear DAO, which is responsible for allocating funding for the ongoing development of the protocol.

### Staking and Fee Sharing

Holders can stake CLEAR to participate in protocol governance and earn a share of protocol fees. Through the vote-bonding mechanism, stakers help direct incentives to where liquidity is needed most in the ecosystem. Learn more about tokenomics.

## Mainnet Token Deployments

The CLEAR token is located at [0x58b9cB810A68a7f3e1E4f8Cb45D1B9B3c79705E8](https://etherscan.io/address/0x58b9cB810A68a7f3e1E4f8Cb45D1B9B3c79705E8) across all supported chains.
