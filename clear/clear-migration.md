# CLEAR Migration

{% include "../.gitbook/includes/review-notice.md" %}

## L2 Holders (Automatic Migration)

If you hold NEXT on any Layer 2 network (Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, BNB, Gnosis), your tokens were automatically upgraded to CLEAR.&#x20;

## L1 Holders (Manual Migration)

If you hold NEXT on Ethereum (L1), you'll need to migrate your tokens manually:

1. Visit the migration portal: [https://stake.everclear.org/migrate-next](https://stake.everclear.org/migrate-next)
2. Connect your wallet containing NEXT tokens
3. Select the amount you wish to migrate
4. Confirm the transaction

## Reversibility

The migration is currently reversible, allowing holders to convert CLEAR back to NEXT while liquidity continues to migrate. To migrate from CLEAR back to NEXT:

1. Visit the [migration portal](https://stake.everclear.org/migrate-next)
2. Click the swap arrow to reverse the migration direction
3. Select the amount to unwrap
4. Confirm the transaction
