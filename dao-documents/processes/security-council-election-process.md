# Security Council Election Process

{% hint style="warning" %}
This document is currently subject to public review before being finalized. If you notice a revision that needs to be made or have feedback, please [request a revision](https://github.com/connext/gitbook-docs/issues/new) or start a conversation with us on Discord at [https://discord.com/invite/everclear](https://discord.com/invite/everclear)
{% endhint %}

Elections for the Security Council are held annually, excluding an initial 6-month bootstrapping phase, during which the Connext Foundation will appoint the initial council.

Before each election cycle, the Connext DAO will open a one-month-long call for candidates, followed by the voting period. The top 8 candidates will then be inducted into the council for one term that will last for 12 months. Serving multiple terms will be possible, however, it will require candidates to submit a new application and be elected into the Security Council through a formal vote.

Changes to these elections may be proposed by the DAO, but not in an ongoing election cycle.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: Prior to the first election, the DAO can post an RFC to discuss whether the term duration should be 6 or 12 months.
