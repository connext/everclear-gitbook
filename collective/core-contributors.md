# Core Contributors

Core Contributors are organizations (for-profit companies, developer guilds, or sub-DAOs) that develop and grow the Everclear protocol.

Core Contributors may be funded by the Everclear DAO and follow the Everclear Improvement Proposal process to get public feedback on proposed protocol changes prior to developing them.

***

### Why Have Many Core Contributors?

A key part of the Everclear vision is for the Everclear protocol to become a true, credibly neutral public good.\
\
The Everclear ecosystemâ€™s philosophy is that this outcome is best achieved by having a wide variety of contributors from many different backgrounds, spanning many different organizations.\
\
In order to minimize governance, the Everclear DAO has initially been set up to fund contributors in NEXT tokens on an ongoing basis via vesting, with the capability for the DAO to adjust tokens vested quarterly or semi-annually based on efficacy and output of various Core Contributors. Core Contributors are then simultaneously:

* **Collaborative** with each other to ensure the best outcome for the Everclear protocol due to their shared collective ownership in the DAO through CLEAR.
* **Competitive** with each other (and with potential new Core Contributors) on ongoing grants of CLEAR from the DAO, ensuring a high quality of execution over potentially many years of research & development.

### List of Core Contributors

As of the time of writing, the following organizations are involved in some capacity as Core Contributors to the Everclear ecosystem.
