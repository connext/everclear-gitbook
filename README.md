### The Everclear Foundation

The Everclear Foundation is a Cayman Islands foundation company that was established for the purpose of supporting the Everclear ecosystem. The Everclear Foundation is an independent entity with fiduciary responsibilities to support the Everclear ecosystem through activities such as strategic stewardship and partnership initiatives.

### Core Contributors

Core Contributors are organizations funded by the DAO to undertake research and development efforts, aimed at improving the Everclear protocol. Core Contributors engage in an open Everclear Governance Proposal (EGP) process to solicit input from the community and propose upgrades.

### The Broader Everclear Community

The Everclear ecosystem encompasses a diverse community comprising users and infrastructure operators, such as routers. This engaged community actively participates in the protocol's utilization, provides feedback, and aids in maintaining the protocol's robustness.
