# Overview

Everclear is a novel public good mechanism for settling intents across chains. This mechanism:

1. Allows fillers to _socialize_ the costs of rebalancing by netting off settlements against other fillers and users in the network.
2. Acts as a programmable layer for fillers or users to build and utilize any number of mechanisms for rebalancing/settling funds (e.g. by plugging into any messaging mechanism, liquidity pool, CEX, etc.)
3. Enables permissionless expansion to new chains and rollups, making it possible for any application on any chain to onboard users from any other chain.
